is the fastest and most size efficient serialization (aka pickling) library that works on both Scala\nand Scala.js. It encodes into a binary format instead of the more customary JSON. A binary format brings efficiency \ngains in both size and speed, at the cost of legibility of the encoded data. BooPickle borrows heavily from both uPickle\nand Prickle so special thanks to Li Haoyi and Ben Hutchison for those two great libraries!\nFeatures\n\nSupports both Scala and Scala.js (no reflection!)\nSerialization support for all primitives, collections, options, tuples and case classes (including class hierarchies)\nUser-definable custom serializers\nTransforming serializers to simplify serializing non-case classes\nHandles references and deduplication of identical objects\nVery fast\nVery efficient coding\nLow memory usage, no intermediate structures needed\nZero dependencies\nScala 2.11/2.12\nAll modern browsers are supported (not IE9 and below, though)\n\nWhat is it good for?\nBooPickle is not a very generic serialization library, so you should think carefully before using it in your application.

All examples in this document assume this import is present.\nimport boopickle.Default._\n\nTo serialize (pickle) something, just call Pickle.intoBytes with your data. This will produce a binary ByteBuffer containing an encoded version\nof your data.\nval data = Seq(\"Hello\", \"World!\")\nval buf = Pickle.intoBytes(data)\n\nAnd to deserialize (unpickle) the buffer, call Unpickle.fromBytes, specifying the type of your data. BooPickle doesn't encode any type information,\nso you must use the same types when pickling and unpickling.\nval helloWorld = Unpickle[Seq[String]].fromBytes(buf)\n\nSupported types\nBooPickle has built-in support for most of the regular Scala types, including\n\nprimitives: Boolean, Byte, Short, Char, Int, Long, Float, Double and String\ncommon types: Tuples, Option, Either, Duration, UUID, BigInt, BigDecimal and ByteBuffer\ncollections, both mutable and immutable, including: Array, Vector, List, Sets, Maps and any Iterable with a CanBuildFrom implementation\ncase classes and case objects (via a macro)\ntraits as a base for a class hierarchy\n\n"},"ClassHierarchies.html":{"url":"ClassHierarchies.html","title":"Class hierarchies","keywords":"","body":"Class hierarchies\nBy default, BooPickle encodes zero type information, which makes it impossible to directly encode a class hierarchy like below and decode it\njust by specifying the parent type Fruit.\ntrait Fruit {\n  val weight: Double\n  def color: String\n}\n\ncase class Banana(weight: Double) extends Fruit {\n  def color = \"yellow\"\n}\n\ncase class Kiwi(weight: Double) extends Fruit {\n  def color = \"brown\"\n}\n\ncase class Carambola(weight: Double) extends Fruit {\n  def color = \"yellow\"\n}\n\nAs this is such a common situation, BooPickle provides a helper class CompositePickler to build a custom pickler for composite types. For the case\nabove, all you need to do is to define an implicit pickler like this, utilizing the compositePickler function from Default:\nimplicit val fruitPickler = compositePickler[Fruit].\n  addConcreteType[Banana].\n  addConcreteType[Kiwi].\n  addConcreteType[Carambola]\n\nNow you can freely pickle any Fruit and when unpickling, BooPickle will know what type to decode.\nval fruits: Seq[Fruit] = Seq(Kiwi(0.5), Kiwi(0.6), Carambola(5.0), Banana(1.2))\nval bb = Pickle.intoBytes(fruits)\n.\n.\nval u = Unpickle[Seq[Fruit]].fromBytes(bb)\nassert(u == fruits)\n\nNote that internally CompositePickler encodes types using indices, so they must be specified in the same order on both sides!\nBooPickle needs to know the type when pickling to deserialize to the correct type, thus this fails\nval b = Banana(1.0)\nval bb = Pickle.intoBytes(b)\nassert(Unpickle[Banana].fromBytes(bb) == b) // This produces Banana\nval bb2 = Pickle.intoBytes(b)\nassert(Unpickle[Fruit].fromBytes(bb2) == null) // This produces null\n\nInstead when pickling declare the parent type\nval f: Fruit = Banana(1.0)\nval bf = Pickle.intoBytes(f)\nassert(Unpickle[Fruit].fromBytes(bf) == f) // This produces a Fruit\n\nRecursive composite types\nIf you have a recursive composite type (a sub type has a reference to the super type), you need to build the CompositePickler in two steps,\nas shown below.\nsealed trait Tree\ncase object Leaf extends Tree\ncase class Node(value: Int, children:Seq[Tree]) extends Tree\n\nobject Tree {\n  implicit val treePickler = compositePickler[Tree]\n  treePickler.addConcreteType[Node].addConcreteType[Leaf.type]\n}\n\nThis is because the compiler must find a pickler for Tree when it's building a pickler for Node.\nAutomatic generation of hierarchy picklers\nIf your type hierarchy is sealed then you can take advantage of the automatic pickler generation feature of BooPickle. A macro automatically generates\nthe required CompositePickler for you, as long as the trait is sealed. For example lets change the Fruit trait to be sealed, so that compiler\nknows all its descendants will be defined in the same file and the macro can find them.\nsealed trait Fruit {\n  val weight: Double\n  def color: String\n}\n\nNow you can directly pickle your fruits without manually defining a CompositePickler.\nval fruits: Seq[Fruit] = Seq(Kiwi(0.5), Kiwi(0.6), Carambola(5.0), Banana(1.2))\nval bb = Pickle.intoBytes(fruits)\n.\n.\nval u = Unpickle[Seq[Fruit]].fromBytes(bb)\nassert(u == fruits)\n\nNote that for some hierarchies the automatic generation may not work (due to Scala compiler limitations), but you can always fall back to the\nmanually defined CompositePickler.\nAlso note that due to the way macros generate picklers, each time you need an implicit instance of the pickler, new classes (and .class files)\nwill be generated. And not just for the top level trait, but for all implementing classes as well. If you have a large class hierarchy, this adds up\nrather quickly!

This way the code is generated only once\nand used whenever you need a pickler for your Fruit.\nobject Fruit {\n  implicit val pickler: Pickler[Fruit] = generatePickler[Fruit]\n}\n\n// must import the companion object, otherwise the implicit macro has higher precedence and will generate another pickler!\nimport Fruit._\nval fruits: Seq[Fruit] = Seq(Kiwi(0.5), Kiwi(0.6), Carambola(5.0), Banana(1.2))\nval bb = Pickle.intoBytes(fruits)\n\nYou can prevent the implicit use of the pickler generator macro by importing boopickle.DefaultBasic._ instead of \nboopickle.Default._ as this will leave the implicit macro code out. Then you can provide specific implicit picklers for your \ncase classes or class hierarchies.\nimport boopickle.DefaultBasic._\nobject Fruit {\n  // use macro explicitly to generate the pickler\n  implicit val pickler: Pickler[Fruit] = PicklerGenerator.generatePickler[Fruit]\n}\n\nIn this case you don't need to import Fruit._ because there is no implicit macro to compete with your pickler in the companion object.\nNote that when not using implicit macro picklers, you must pay special attention to the creation order of picklers in more complex situations like below.\nimport boopickle.DefaultBasic._\nsealed trait MyTrait\n\ncase class TT1(i: Int) extends MyTrait\n\ncase class TT2(s: String, next: MyTrait) extends MyTrait\n\nclass TT3(val i: Int, val s: String) extends MyTrait\n\nobject MyTrait {\n  // picklers must be created in correct order, because TT2 depends on MyTrait\n  implicit val pickler = compositePickler[MyTrait]\n  // use macro explicitly to generate picklers for TT1 and TT2\n  implicit val pickler1 = PicklerGenerator.generatePickler[TT1]\n  implicit val pickler2 = PicklerGenerator.generatePickler[TT2]\n  // a pickler for TT3 cannot be generated by macro, so use a transform pickler\n  implicit val pickler3 = transformPickler[TT3, (Int, String)](t => (t.i, t.s), t => new TT3(t._1, t._2))\n  pickler.addConcreteType[TT1].addConcreteType[TT2].addConcreteType[TT3]\n}\n\nComplex type hierarchies\nWhen you have more complex type hierarchies with multiple levels of traits, you might need picklers for each type level. A simple example to illustrate:\nsealed trait Element\n\nsealed trait Document extends Element\n\nsealed trait Attribute extends Element\n\nfinal case class WordDocument(text:String) extends Document\n\nfinal case class OwnerAttribute(owner: String, parent: Element) extends Attribute\n\nBuilding a CompositePickler for Element with the two implementation classes doesn't actually give you a pickler for Document nor Attribute. So\nyou need to define those picklers separately, duplicating the implementation classes. For this purpose CompositePickler allows you to join existing\ncomposite picklers to form a new one.\nobject Element {\n  implicit val documentPickler = compositePickler[Document]\n  documentPickler.addConcreteType[WordDocument]\n\n  implicit val attributePickler = compositePickler[Attribute]\n  attributePickler.addConcreteType[OwnerAttribute]\n\n  implicit val elementPickler = compositePickler[Element]\n  elementPickler.join[Document].join[Attribute]\n}\n\nWith these picklers you may now pickle any trait. Note, however, that you must use the same CompositePickler when unpickling. You cannot pickle with Element \nand unpickle with Attribute even if the actual class was OwnerAttribute because internal indexes are different for each composite pickler.\n"},"AdvancedPickling.html":{"url":"AdvancedPickling.html","title":"Advanced pickling","keywords":"","body":"Advanced pickling\nReferences\nIf your data contains the same object multiple times, BooPickle will encode it only once and use a reference for the remaining occurrences. For example\nthe data below is correctly unpickled to contain references to the same p instances.\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\n\nval p = Point(5, 10)\nval points = Vector(p, p, p, p)\nval bb = Pickle.intoBytes(points)\n.\n.\nval newPoints = Unpickle[Vector[Point]].fromBytes(bb)\nassert(newPoints(0) eq newPoints(1))\n\nReference identity is checked by actual object identity, not by its equal method, so a val a = List(2) and val b = List(2) are two\ndifferent objects and will not be replaced by each other in pickling.\nCustom picklers\nIf you need to pickle non-case classes or for example Java classes, you can define custom picklers for them. If it's a non-generic type,\nuse an implicit object and for generic types use implicit def. See Pickler.scala for more detailed examples such\nas Either[T, S] below.\nIn most cases, however, you can use the TransformPickler to create a custom pickler for a type by transforming it into another type that\nalready has pickler support. For example you can transform a java.util.Date into a Long and back. More complex classes can be transformed\nto a suitable Tuple. \nimplicit val datePickler = transformPickler((t: Long) => new java.util.Date(t))(_.getTime)\n\nNote that transformation breaks reference equality, so multiple instances of the same reference will be pickled\nseparately. Transforming picklers can also be used in CompositePickler with the addTransform method.\nFor a full pickler you need to do as in the example below. It's optimizing encoding size by reusing the slot for identity reference for\nthe string length.\nclass Custom(val name: String, value: Int)\n\nobject MyCustomPicklers extends PicklerHelper {\n  implicit object customPickler extends P[Custom] {\n    override def pickle(obj: Custom)(implicit state: PickleState): Unit = {\n      state.identityRefFor(obj) match {\n        case Some(idx) =>\n          state.enc.writeInt(-idx)\n        case None =>\n          // writeString will write an Int with the string length that we can\n          // put at same position as identity ref\n          state.enc.writeString(obj.name)\n          state.enc.writeInt(obj.value)\n          state.addIdentityRef(obj)\n      }\n    }\n\n    override def unpickle(implicit state: UnpickleState): Custom = {\n      state.dec.readInt match {\n        case idx if idx \n          state.identityFor[Custom](-idx)\n        case len =>\n          val c = new Custom(state.dec.readString(len), state.dec.readInt)\n          state.addIdentityRef(c)\n          c\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn principle the pickler should do following things:\n\ncheck if the object has been pickled already using state.identityRefFor(obj) (if you want deduplication)\nif yes, store an index to the reference (this also takes care of null values)\nit not, encode the class using state.enc and/or calling picklers for members\nif your class has a length, you can encode it in the same space as reference index by using a non-negative value\nfinally add the object to the identity reference\n\nIf your object is immutable, you can use immutableRefFor and addImmutableRef instead for even more efficient encoding.\nOn the unpickling side you'll need to do following:\n\nread reference/length using state.readInt\ndepending on the result,\nget an existing reference\nor use length to know how much to unpickle\n\n\nunpickle class members\nfinally add the reference to identity table\n\nException picklers\nBooPickle has special helpers to simplify pickling most common exception types. A call to exceptionPickler gives you a pickler\nthat supports all the typical Java/Scala exceptions and you can then add your own custom exceptions with addException. The exception pickler\nis a CompositePickler[Throwable] so your exceptions should be presented as Throwable to pickling functions.\nimplicit val exPickler = exceptionPickler.addException[MyException](m => new MyException(m))\n\nval ex: Throwable = new IllegalArgumentException(\"No, no, no!\")\nval bb = Pickle.intoBytes(ex)\n\nNote that the basic addException mechanism only pickles the exception message, not any other fields. If you wish to pickle more\nfields, create transform picklers described above with the addTransform function. The same CompositePickler can contain both regular\nexception picklers and transform picklers.\n"},"Optimization.html":{"url":"Optimization.html","title":"Optimization","keywords":"","body":"Optimizations strategies\nBuffer pooling\nWhen BooPickle codecs allocate ByteBuffers they do it via BufferProvider classes. The default implementations for both heap and direct buffers utilize\nthe BufferPool object for recycling buffers. Buffer providers automatically release intermediate ByteBuffers back to the pool when their contents\nis copied to a new buffer. To improve pool performance, you should release buffers that are not used anymore by calling BufferPool.release. Only\nbuffers allocated through the BufferProvider should be released to the pool.\nval data = Pickle.intoBytes(fruits)\n// send data to client\n...\n// release buffer back to pool\nBufferPool.release(data)\n\nThe pool has a maximum size to prevent it from locking down too much memory and it also only recycles relatively small buffers.\nIn a multi-threaded environment you may experience some slowdown if multiple threads are actively using BufferPool. In these cases it may make sense to\ndisable pooling globally with BufferPool.disable().\nDeduplication\nBooPickle supports deduplication of pickled case classes and strings. If you know your data won't have duplicates, you can enhance performance by disabling it\nby setting the deduplicate and dedupImmutable parameters in PickleState and UnpickleState constructors to false. The effect of deduplication is that\nwhen the same object is encountered again while pickling, only a reference is stored. When unpickling the reference is used instead of unpickling the object\nagain. This saves space and enhances performance if your data contains a lot of copies of same objects.\nThere are two different methods of deduplication. First one compares object identities directly and the second compares object contents. The first one can be\nused for any objects but the second is safe to use only with immutable objects because only a single instance is created when unpickling and is used for all\nreferences. In the provided picklers immutable deduplication is used only for Strings, but you can use it in your own picklers if you have immutable data that\nis duplicated a lot.\nNote that deduplication can severely affect pickling performance (not that much unpickling), especially if you are pickling a lot of non-duplicated objects in\none go.\nTo implicitly provide non-deduplicating PickleState and UnpickleState, use following code.\nimplicit def pickleState = new PickleState(new EncoderSize, false, false)\nimplicit val unpickleState = (bb: ByteBuffer) => new UnpickleState(new DecoderSize(bb), false, false)\n\nCodecs\nOriginally BooPickle had a single codec optimized for both size and speed. From 1.2.0 onwards there are now two codecs, the original one optimized\nfor size and a new codec optimized for speed (especially in the browser).\nThe speed oriented codec (EncodeSpeed and DecodeSpeed) works reliably only within a single application as it may dynamically choose different\nencoding methods based on the environment. You should therefore not use it in network communication.\nThe codec is chosen as part of building an instance of PickleState and UnpickleState, which implicitly chooses the size optimized codec by\ndefault. To override this you can either manually create the instances of pickle states, or define an implicit to override the defaults. For\nUnpickleState you need to define a function taking a ByteBuffer and returning an instance of UnpickleState as in the example below. This will\nthen be used by the Unpickle[A].fromBytes function.\nimplicit def pickleState: PickleState = new PickleState(new EncoderSpeed)\nimplicit val unpickleState = (b: ByteBuffer) => new UnpickleState(new DecoderSpeed(b))\n\nTuning ByteBuffer performance\nIn the browser BooPickle uses direct ByteBuffers by default, as they perform much better. On the server JVM, however, heap buffers tend to be more\nefficient in many cases and are used by default. The Encoder constructor takes a BufferProvider argument and you can supply your\nown or use one of the two predefined ones: DirectByteBufferProvider and HeapByteBufferProvider. The ByteBuffers must use\nlittle-endian ordering.\nWhen serializing large objects, BooPickle encodes them into multiple separate ByteBuffers that are combined (copied) in the call to\nintoBytes. If you can handle a sequence of buffers (for example sending them over the network), you can use intoByteBuffers instead,\nwhich will avoid duplicating the serialized data.\nPerformance testing\nAs one of the main design goals of BooPickle was performance (both in execution speed as in data size), the project includes a sub-project for comparing\nBooPickle performance with other common pickling libraries available for Scala.js: uPickle, Prickle, Circe and Pushka. To access the performance tests, just\nswitch to perftestsJS or perftestsJVM project.\nOn the JVM you can run the tests simply with the run command and the output will be shown in the SBT console. You might want to run the\ntest at least twice to ensure JVM has optimized the code properly.\nOn the JS side, you'll need to use fullOptJS and package to compile the code into JavaScript and then run it in your browser at\nhttp://localhost:12345/perftests/js/target/scala-2.11/classes/index.html \nTo ensure good results, run the tests at least twice in the browser.\nBoth tests provide similar output, although there are small differences in the Gzipped sizes due to the use of different libraries.\nIn the browser (BooPickle! is using the speed optimized codec with deduplication disabled):\n15/16 : Encoding Seq[Book] with numerical IDs\n=============================================\nLibrary    ops/s      %          size       %          size.gz    %\nBooPickle  80880      41.8%      210        100%       193        100%\nBooPickle! 193416     100.0%     402        191%       210        109%\nPrickle    9172       4.7%       863        411%       272        141%\nuPickle    19372      10.0%      680        324%       233        121%\nCirce      10096      5.2%       680        324%       233        121%\nPushka     29176      15.1%      680        324%       233        121%\n\n16/16 : Decoding Seq[Book] with numerical IDs\n=============================================\nLibrary    ops/s      %          size       %          size.gz    %\nBooPickle  85156      100.0%     210        100%       193        100%\nBooPickle! 73576      86.4%      402        191%       210        109%\nPrickle    1704       2.0%       863        411%       272        141%\nuPickle    8872       10.4%      680        324%       233        121%\nCirce      7204       8.5%       680        324%       233        121%\nPushka     18044      21.2%      680        324%       233        121%\nUnder JVM:\n15/16 : Encoding Seq[Book] with numerical IDs\n=============================================\nLibrary    ops/s      %          size       %          size.gz    %\nBooPickle  548684     57.6%      210        100%       188        100%\nBooPickle! 951836     100.0%     402        191%       205        109%\nPrickle    44360      4.7%       879        419%       276        147%\nuPickle    139328     14.6%      680        324%       234        124%\nCirce      52964      5.6%       680        324%       234        124%\nPushka     151672     15.9%      680        324%       234        124%\n\n16/16 : Decoding Seq[Book] with numerical IDs\n=============================================\nLibrary    ops/s      %          size       %          size.gz    %\nBooPickle  732512     96.2%      210        100%       188        100%\nBooPickle! 761296     100.0%     402        191%       205        109%\nPrickle    5308       0.7%       879        419%       276        147%\nuPickle    88424      11.6%      680        324%       234        124%\nCirce      66248      8.7%       680        324%       234        124%\nPushka     142252     18.7%      680        324%       234        124%\nPerformance test suite measures how many encode or decode operations the library can do in one second and also checks the size of the raw\nand gzipped output.

Just look at the examples provided\nand model your own data (as realistically as possible) to see which library works best for you.\n"},"Details.html":{"url":"Details.html","title":"Internal details","keywords":"","body":"Internal details\nEfficient coding\nBooPickle makes assumptions of what kind of data it needs to encode, to reach high efficiency in typical scenarios. For example an Int (which takes\n32-bits or 4 bytes) is encoded in 1-5 bytes depending on the value. The most common values (0-127) take only a single byte, whereas larger values\nrequire more bytes. Because very large integers take 5 bytes, if you know your data consists mainly of such values, you could specifically code them\nusing raw format that always takes 32-bits. Similarly Longs are also coded in 1-9 bytes depending on the value.\nIn many situations there is a need to encode a length (of String, Seq, Map, etc.) and the efficient Int coding is used. But because a length/size is always\nnon-negative, we can use negative integers to indicate other things. BooPickle supports coding multiple instances of the same object reference by using\na reference value. The length value is reused to encode the reference by just flipping it into a negative value.\nNote that when using the speed optimized codecs (EncodeSpeed and DecodeSpeed) some of these size optimizations are not used.\nAutomatic pickler generation with macros\nScala features powerful macros to help simplifying many mundane programming tasks. One\nsuch task is writing pickling functions for classes. Consider the simple case class below:\ncase class Person(foreName: String, lastName: String, email: String, birthYear: Int)\n\nTo pickle this, you'd need to write following code:\nimplicit object PersonPickler extends Pickler[Person] {\n  override def pickle(value: Person)(implicit state: PickleState): Unit = {\n    state.pickle(value.foreName)\n    state.pickle(value.lastName)\n    state.pickle(value.email)\n    state.pickle(value.birthYear)\n  }\n  override def unpickle(implicit state: UnpickleState): Person = {\n    Person( \n      state.unpickle[String],\n      state.unpickle[String],\n      state.unpickle[String],\n      state.unpickle[Int]\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nThis would be very tedious, which is why practically all serialization libraries use either reflection or macros to automate this task. BooPickle\nbeing fully compatible with Scala.js, reflection is not an option, so macros it is. Programming macros in Scala is quite difficult, because it's a very\nrecent addition to the Scala compiler and the documentation tends to be terse and somewhat cryptic. Also many examples found in the net are already\nobsolete or wrong if you use Scala 2.11. Best course of action is to look at existing macro code and try to deduce what's going on. Both\nuPickle and Prickle provided good base for BooPickle's macros.\nThe macro-generated picklers are provided by a separate trait to make sure they are the last resort the compiler turns to.\ntrait MaterializePicklerFallback {\n  implicit def generatePickler[T]: Pickler[T] = macro PicklerMaterializersImpl.materializePickler[T]\n}\n\nIf no other implicit pickler can be found, the compiler will call the materializePickler macro function in the hope of generating a suitable one.\nThe macro code starts\nby checking that the given type is valid for pickling (a sealed trait or a case class). Next step is building the code for pickling individual fields\nof the case class, which is surprisingly simple. Scala macros use a concept called quasiquotes (q\"\"\"code goes here\"\"\") to easily generate code.\nval accessors = (tpe.decls collect {\n  case acc: MethodSymbol if acc.isCaseAccessor => acc\n}).toList\n\nval pickleFields = for {\n  accessor \nBecause there might be more than one instance of the case class in the structure we are pickling, additional code is generated to check for that\nand to store just a reference instead, if needed.

Unpickle logic generation is pretty much the same, check out the code for details.\nBooPickle also supports automatic pickler generation for sealed class hierarchies and that functionality is also implemented by the macro. When the macro\nfirst checks if it's a trait, it will continue under a different code path than for case classes. Goal of the macro is to create a CompositePickler\nfor the given trait so that all implementing classes are included.\nFirst step is to make some sanity checks and then find all the known subclasses. This is why the trait must be sealed so that the compiler knows\nall subclasses and the macro can generate correct code. Next all found subclasses are mapped to addConcreteType[$s] code blocks that are embedded into a\ngenerated CompositePickler.\nq\"\"\"\n  implicit object $name extends boopickle.CompositePickler[$tpe] {\n    ..$concreteTypes\n  }\n  $name\n\"\"\"\n\nFast UTF-8 coding in the browser\nUTF-8 is pretty much the universal character coding format used in the web. For example JSON data is always coded in UTF-8 and naturally all browsers\nare very good and efficient at processing UTF-8 formatted text. But when you actually have to do UTF-8 encoding or decoding in JavaScript the situation\nis much worse. You can have strings and arrays of bytes, but regular JavaScript doesn't provide decent methods for converting between these two.\nOne option is to write your own UTF-8 codec and this is exactly what the Scala.js library provides. Its performance is not so great when compared to\nnative JSON processing but it gets the job done. \nLuckily there is a JavaScript extension known as TextEncoder, which provides native\nspeed encoding of UTF-8 (and some other formats, too). The TextEncoder (and TextDecoder) work with typed arrays (Uint8Array in this case) that\nare a high-performance alternative to basic JS arrays.\nBecause these interfaces are not available on all browsers, the string codec code must check for their availability and fall back to regular implementation\nif they are missing.\nclass TextEncoder extends js.Object {\n  def encode(str: String): Uint8Array = js.native\n}\n\nprivate lazy val utf8encoder: (String) => Int8Array = {\n  val te = new TextEncoder\n  // use native TextEncoder\n  (str: String) => new Int8Array(te.encode(str))\n}\n\ndef encodeUTF8(s: String): ByteBuffer = {\n  if (js.isUndefined(js.Dynamic.global.TextEncoder)) {\n    StandardCharsets.UTF_8.encode(s)\n  } else {\n    TypedArrayBuffer.wrap(utf8encoder(s))\n  }\n}\n\n"},"Misc.html":{"url":"Misc.html","title":"Miscellaneous","keywords":"","body":"Using BooPickle with Ajax\nFor now, see SPA tutorial for example usage.\nKnown limitations\nBooPickle is first and foremost focused on optimization of the pickled data. This gives you good performance and small data size, but at the same\ntime it also makes the protocol extremely fragile. Unlike JSON, which can survive quite easily from additional or missing data, the binary\nformat employed by BooPickle will explode violently with even the slightest of change. Debugging the output of BooPickle is also very hard, first\nbecause it's in binary and second because many data types use exotic coding to reduce the size. For example an Int can be 1 to 5 bytes long. Since\nthere is no type information included in the coding it's quite impossible to determine the structure of the data just by looking at the binary output.\nBut because there is no type information, it is also possible to benefit from this. For example you can pickle a Set[String] but unpickle it\nas a Vector[String] because all collections use the same serialization format internally. Note, however, that this too is rather fragile, \nespecially for empty collections that occur multiple times in the data.\nIf your data contains a lot of (non-repeating) strings, then BooPickle performance is not so hot (depending on browser) as it has to do\nUTF-8 coding itself. Several browsers provide a TextDecoder interface to do this efficiently, but it's still not as fast as with JSON.parse. On\nother browsers, BooPickle relies on Scala.js' implementation for coding UTF-8.\nUnder Scala.js BooPickle depends indirectly on typed arrays \nbecause direct ByteBuffers are implemented with typed arrays. These may not be available on all JS platforms (most notably old Node.js, which has\nits own Buffers, and IE versions 9 and below). When testing code that uses BooPickle (and direct ByteBuffers), make sure your tests are run under\na recent version of Node.js as Rhino doesn't support typed arrays. Alternatively make sure your tests only use heap ByteBuffers.\nCommon issues with ByteBuffers\nAs many BooPickle users have run into issues with ByteBuffers, here is a bit of advice on how to work with them. If you need to get data out of a \nByteBuffer, for example into an Array[Byte] the safest way is to use the get(array: Array[Byte]) method. Even when the ByteBuffer is\nbacked with an Array[Byte] and you could access that directly with array(), it's very easy to make mistakes with positions, array offsets and limits.\nReading values from a ByteBuffer commonly changes its internal state (the position), so you cannot treat it as identical to the original\nByteBuffer. Similarly writing to one also changes its state. For example if you write data to a ByteBuffer and pass it as such to an unpickler, \nit will not work. You need to call flip() first to reset its position.\nIn BooPickle ByteBuffers use little-endian ordering, which is not the default in the JVM, but is the native ordering in majority of target platforms. If you\ncall slice or duplicate on buffers produced by BooPickle, they will default back to big-endian ordering. You must explicitly call\norder(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN) to get them back to correct ordering.\nFor more information, please refer to the JDK documentation on ByteBuffers.\nUsing ByteBuffers in network communication\nBooPickle is commonly used in client/server communication, so it is important to be able to use ByteBuffers efficiently in the protocol. On the JVM\nside things are usually quite simple as many communication methods already accept ByteBuffer type directly. Sometimes you do need to convert the\ndata into an Array[Byte] using following piece of code:\nval data = Array.ofDim[Byte](buffer.remaining())\nbuffer.get(data)\n\nConversion in the other direction is trivial with the help of ByteBuffer.wrap() method.\nOn the JS side things are a bit more complicated due to the use of JavaScript ArrayBuffer underneath the ByteBuffer.\n"}}}
